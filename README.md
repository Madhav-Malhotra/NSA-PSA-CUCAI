### Accompanying Repository for the Paper "Bio-inspired AI for Lightweight Network Intrusion Detection for Industrial IoT"

This repository contains the code needed to reproduce results from the paper "Bio-inspired AI for Lightweight Network Intrusion Detection for Industrial IoT" published at the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI (2024).

The repository is organized as follows:
- `data/`: contains the notebook used to process the datasets used in the paper. The [processed datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yenzeinkok/creating-a-smaller-dataset-for-ciciot2023/output?select=0.001percent_2classes.csv) are hosted on Kaggle. The original data comes from the [CIC-IoT-2023 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhavmalhotra/unb-cic-iot-dataset).
- `model-training/`: contains notebooks used to train and evaluate the models presented in the paper.
- `model-profiling/`: contains scripts used to measure the memory usage and inference time of the models.
